## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of AstroPaper, you'll see the following folders and files:

```bash
/
├── public/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── logo.svg
│   │   └── logo.png
│   └── favicon.svg
│   └── astropaper-og.jpg
│   └── robots.txt
│   └── toggle-theme.js
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── socialIcons.ts
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   │   |  blog/
│   │   |    └── some-blog-posts.md
│   │   └── config.ts
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
│   └── styles/
│   └── utils/
│   └── config.ts
│   └── types.ts
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All blog posts are stored in `src/content/blog` directory.
